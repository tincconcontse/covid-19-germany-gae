## How to Use Quick Fix Sliders in Capture NX 2
 
One of the easiest ways to improve your photos in Capture NX 2 is to use the Quick Fix sliders. These sliders are located in the Edit List panel on the right side of the screen. They allow you to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, and other aspects of your image with a simple drag of the mouse.
 
To use the Quick Fix sliders, follow these steps:

1. Select the image you want to edit in the Browser panel on the left side of the screen.
2. Click on the Quick Fix tab in the Edit List panel.
3. Drag the sliders to adjust the settings as you like. You can see the changes in real time on your image.
4. If you want to reset a slider to its default value, double-click on it.
5. If you want to compare your edited image with the original one, click on the Compare button at the bottom of the screen.
6. If you are happy with your edits, click on Save or Save As to save your image.

You can also use the Quick Fix sliders to edit only a portion of your image. To do this, you need to create a selection using one of the selection tools, such as Auto Retouch Brush, Selection Brush, or Lasso. Then, apply the Quick Fix sliders only to that selection. You can also invert or feather your selection for more precise control.
